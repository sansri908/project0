The first page, the index page contains a picture of a smiley face. There are hyperlinks in each page which are green, and when you hover above them, they become bigger and become blue.

The second page contains a short description of me.

The third page contains a table which has my favorite things in it. I used bootstrap tables, headings, and hyperlinks in this.

The last page contains an ordered list and an unordered list inside it, and they describe my hobbies.
